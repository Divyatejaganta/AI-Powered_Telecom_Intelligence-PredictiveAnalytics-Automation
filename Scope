High-Level Design Document

Project Title: AI/ML Use Cases in Telecom

1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level design (HLD) for implementing AI/ML use cases in the Telecom domain. The primary objective is to enhance network efficiency, improve customer experience, and enable proactive maintenance through predictive analytics.

2. System Overview

The system is designed to process telecom data, execute AI/ML models, and automate decision-making using Camunda BPMN for orchestration. The workflow ensures seamless data ingestion, processing, model execution, and monitoring.

3. Architecture Components

3.1 Data Sources

Network Logs

Customer Support Interactions

IoT Sensor Data

Call Detail Records (CDRs)

Billing and Subscription Data

3.2 Data Processing Layer

ETL Pipelines for data extraction, transformation, and loading

Feature Engineering for AI/ML model training

3.3 AI/ML Models

Predictive Maintenance: Detects potential network failures

Network Anomaly Detection: Identifies security threats and performance degradation

Customer Churn Prediction: Forecasts customer attrition for proactive engagement

3.4 Camunda-Based Orchestration Workflow

Camunda BPMN Modeler is used to define, execute, and monitor AI-driven workflows. The workflow consists of the following steps:

Data Ingestion

Connects to multiple data sources

Initiates ETL processes

Data Preprocessing

Cleans and normalizes raw data

Extracts relevant features for ML models

Model Execution

Runs AI/ML models based on predefined conditions

Uses Camunda Decision Gateway for result-based routing

Decision Making & Automated Actions

Detects anomalies and triggers alerts

Predicts customer churn and triggers retention strategies

Continuous Monitoring & Retraining

Tracks model performance and initiates retraining workflows if accuracy drops below the threshold

Logs model metrics for real-time observability

4. Deployment Strategy

Containerization: Docker-based deployment for portability

Orchestration: Kubernetes for managing AI/ML workloads

Scalability: Auto-scaling mechanisms based on demand

5. Monitoring & Logging

Performance Metrics: Model accuracy, latency, and resource utilization

Alerting System: Automated notifications for model degradation

Visualization: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring dashboards

6. Technology Stack

Data Processing: Apache Spark, Pandas

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

Orchestration: Camunda BPMN Modeler

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes

Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana

7. Conclusion

This design document presents a structured approach to integrating AI/ML into Telecom operations, ensuring automation, scalability, and real-time decision-making. The Camunda workflow enhances orchestration, enabling a seamless end-to-end AI pipeline for improved network reliability and customer engagement.
